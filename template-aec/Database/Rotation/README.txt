
These motation files were copied from REACCH2/DATABASE (By Roger)

These copies are now specific to the FlexCropping project and can be modified as needed.

The cropping systems that are not used for FlexCropping should be deleted.

Once these files have been 'solidified' delete this README file.

These are the rotations that are needed (Bryan will update)
