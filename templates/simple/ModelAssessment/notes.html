<H1>Subproject specialiations for Harsimran's thesis</H1>

This subproject provides simulation control that 
that will allow Harsimran to emulate using the tool 
for different years.
<P>
One of the features of the tool is the sowing date can be selected 
by the CropSyst model.
In the actual use of the tool the simulation will be run for the current real year.
<P>
In order to evaluate the sowing date selection 
Harsimran will need to emulate the 'current' year.
This can be accomplished by running the simulation with 
years selected to have representitive climatic conditions.
(I.e. where the 'current' year may be either warm or cool
such that the sowing date will noticably vary.)

<H2>Emulating the current year</H2>

The simulation start date is specified in simulation control
(.CS_control)
To allow the scenario generator to automatically apply alternate
'current' years, a <B>Simulation/Control</B> sub directory is added to the <B>Database</B>
directory created for the subproject.
In this directory a .CS_control file would be added for each desired
test climate (year).  These file can have any name.

<H3>Database/Simulation (Kaur subproject only) </H3>

The Database/Simulation folder contains subdirectories with generation fragments.
Because these fragments are under the Database folder they will be used for
combinatorial generation (Each subdirectory constitutes an scenario level).
<P>
Kaur/Database/Simulation provides additional Simulation generation fragments 
to allow the emulation of representative 'current' years.
This would not be applicable for the general use of the Flex Cropping tool.
